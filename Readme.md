Makes your javascript files support React jsx correctly.

Javascript syntax from [pangloss/vim-javascript](https://github.com/pangloss/vim-javascript)

Jsx highlight and indent code changed from [MaxMEllon/vim-jsx-pretty](https://github.com/MaxMEllon/vim-jsx-pretty)

- Fixed syntax highlighting and indentation for React jsx files.
- Works well with xml.vim

This plugin have no dependency, all the code you need for jsx and javascript is
included.

**Note:** you need to disable **vim-javascript** plugin if have installed, I have to
change some highlight group to make it works with jsx.

### Installation

version of vim8 and neovim.

Use `let g:jsx_improve_javascriptreact = 0` to disable javascriptreact support.
